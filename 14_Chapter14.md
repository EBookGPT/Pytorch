# Chapter 14: PyTorch Deployment

"When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of deployability." - Sergey Zagoruyko (Special Guest)

Welcome to the final chapter of our PyTorch textbook! In this chapter, we will discuss how to deploy your PyTorch models into production. After training your PyTorch models, the next natural step is to deploy them so that they can be utilized by end-users.

Deploying PyTorch models can be a complex process, but it is essential to ensure that your models are used effectively. In this chapter, we will explore different deployment strategies, including on-premises, cloud, and edge deployments.

We are excited to have Sergey Zagoruyko, a PyTorch core developer and research scientist at Facebook AI, as a special guest in this chapter. He will share his valuable insights on deploying PyTorch models at scale.

As we have learned in the previous chapter about Debugging and Visualization in PyTorch, being able to debug and analyze models is crucial. In this chapter, we will also discuss how to monitor and test deployed models to ensure that they are performing correctly.

So, are you ready to learn how to deploy your PyTorch models like a pro? Let's dive in and explore the world of PyTorch deployment! 

To start, let's look at an example of deploying a PyTorch model to a mobile device using the PyTorch Mobile framework.

```python
import torch
import torchvision

# Load a pre-trained model
model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Set model to eval mode
model.eval()

# Export the tracing data from PyTorch
example = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)
traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(model, example)

# Save the model to a file
traced_script_module.save("model.pt")
```

In the code snippet above, we first load a pre-trained ResNet18 model from the torchvision package. We then set the model to evaluation mode and use the tracing feature of PyTorch to trace the model's execution graph. Lastly, we save the traced model to a file, which can then be loaded and deployed to a mobile device using the PyTorch Mobile framework.

Stay tuned for more exciting examples and insights from Sergey Zagoruyko as we dive deeper into PyTorch deployment!
# Chapter 14: PyTorch Deployment

Once upon a time, there was a young data scientist named Dorothy. She had worked hard on her PyTorch models, spending countless hours training and tweaking them to achieve the highest accuracy possible. Now she was ready to deploy her models into production and share her insights with the world.

However, Dorothy was not sure where to start. She had never deployed a PyTorch model before, and the process seemed complex and intimidating. She expressed her concerns to her friend Toto, who suggested seeking help from the wise wizard, Sergey Zagoruyko.

Dorothy and Toto set out to find the wizard, following the yellow brick road to his mountainous lair. When they arrived, they were greeted by Sergey himself, who welcomed them with open arms.

"Welcome, young data scientist," Sergey said, "I have been expecting you. I understand you seek knowledge on how to deploy your PyTorch models into production."

Dorothy nodded eagerly, and Sergey led them to a large chamber filled with advanced computer equipment. "Deploying PyTorch models can be a challenging task, but with the right knowledge and tools, anything is possible," he said, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

Together, they discussed the different deployment strategies for PyTorch models, including on-premises, cloud, and edge deployments. Sergey shared his experience from Facebook AI, where PyTorch models are deployed at scale, and provided valuable insights on the best practices and tools for each deployment type.

After several hours of intense discussion, Sergey suggested that they use the PyTorch Mobile framework to deploy their model to mobile devices. He demonstrated a code snippet that would load a pre-trained ResNet18 model, trace its execution graph, and save the traced model to a file for deployment.

Dorothy was impressed, but she still had a few concerns about deploying her models. She was worried about debugging and monitoring them after they were in production. Sergey smiled kindly and explained how to use visualization tools and metrics to monitor the models' performance over time.

Dorothy left the mountain feeling confident and ready to deploy her PyTorch models. She knew that with Sergey's guidance, she could achieve great success as a data scientist.

And so, dear readers, remember that deploying PyTorch models may seem complex, but with the right tools and knowledge, anything is possible. Always seek help from experts like Sergey Zagoruyko and never give up on the pursuit of knowledge and innovation!
## Code explanation

In the Wizard of Oz parable, we discussed using the PyTorch Mobile framework to deploy a PyTorch model to a mobile device. Here, we will explain the code snippet used in the chapter.

```python
import torch
import torchvision

# Load a pre-trained model
model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Set model to eval mode
model.eval()

# Export the tracing data from PyTorch
example = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)
traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(model, example)

# Save the model to a file
traced_script_module.save("model.pt")
```

The code begins by importing the PyTorch and torchvision packages. The `torchvision.models` package provides several pre-trained models that can be used for different tasks such as image and text classification, object detection, and segmentation. Here, we load a ResNet18 model, which is a popular convolutional neural network architecture.

Next, we set the model to evaluation mode using the `model.eval()` command. This ensures that any dropout or batch normalization layers are fixed, and the model can be used for inference.

The next step is to export the model's tracing data from PyTorch. This process involves executing the model once with a dummy input and recording the operations and their inputs/outputs. This recorded data is then used to create a traced model, which is a serialized representation of the operations and its parameters.

Here, we create a random example tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 224, 224)`, which represents one RGB image of size 224x224. We then use the `torch.jit.trace` function to trace the model's execution graph, passing the pre-trained model and the example tensor as inputs.

Finally, we save the traced model to a file named `model.pt`. This file can then be deployed to a mobile device, where the PyTorch Mobile framework can load and execute the model.

And that's it! Now you have learned how to deploy a PyTorch model using the PyTorch Mobile framework. Remember, this is just one of many deployment strategies, and it is essential to choose the right method based on your use case and requirements.
