# The Code Behind the Parable: Advanced Topics in PyTorch

In the Wizard of Oz parable, Dorothy was able to learn about various advanced topics in PyTorch, including transfer learning, generative models, reinforcement learning, and distributed training. In this section, we'll take a closer look at the code used to implement some of these concepts.

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models for different tasks such as fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a new dataset. PyTorch provides a built-in library of pre-trained models called TorchVision. Here's an example of how to use fine-tuning for image classification on a new dataset:

```python
import torch
import torchvision
from torch import nn, optim
from torch.optim import lr_scheduler
import numpy as np
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Specify the pre-trained model and load the weights
model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Freeze the weights of the convolutional layers
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Replace the fully connected layer with a new one that is trained to classify the new dataset
num_features = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)

# Set up the optimizer and the scheduler
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.fc.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
scheduler = lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=7, gamma=0.1)

# Train the model on the new dataset
total_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(total_epochs):
    for phase in ['train', 'val']:
        if phase == 'train':
            # Set the model to training mode
            model.train()
        else:
            # Set the model to evaluation mode
            model.eval()

        # Iterate over the dataloader and perform the forward and backward pass
        for inputs, labels in dataloaders[phase]:
            inputs = inputs.to(device)
            labels = labels.to(device)

            optimizer.zero_grad()

            with torch.set_grad_enabled(phase == 'train'):
                outputs = model(inputs)
                loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

                if phase == 'train':
                    loss.backward()
                    optimizer.step()

        if phase == 'train':
            scheduler.step()
```

## Generative Models

Generative models allow us to generate new data that resembles the original dataset. Here's an example of how to build a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
from torch import nn
from torch.nn import functional as F

class VAE(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(VAE, self).__init__()

        # Encoder
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 400)
        self.fc21 = nn.Linear(400, 20)
        self.fc22 = nn.Linear(400, 20)

        # Decoder
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(20, 400)
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(400, 784)

    def encode(self, x):
        h1 = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc21(h1), self.fc22(h1)

    def reparameterize(self, mu, logvar):
        std = torch.exp(0.5*logvar)
        eps = torch.randn_like(std)
        return mu + eps*std

    def decode(self, z):
        h3 = F.relu(self.fc3(z))
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc4(h3))

    def forward(self, x):
        mu, logvar = self.encode(x.view(-1, 784))
        z = self.reparameterize(mu, logvar)
        return self.decode(z), mu, logvar
```

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make decisions based on rewards received from the environment. Here's an example of how to implement the REINFORCE algorithm in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
from torch import nn, optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Policy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Policy, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.softmax(self.fc2(x), dim=1)
        return x

def select_action(state):
    state = torch.from_numpy(state).float().unsqueeze(0)
    probs = policy(state)
    m = torch.distributions.Categorical(probs)
    action = m.sample()
    policy.saved_log_probs.append(m.log_prob(action))
    return action.item()

def finish_episode():
    R = 0
    policy_loss = []
    returns = []
    for r in policy.rewards[::-1]:
        R = r + gamma * R
        returns.insert(0, R)
    returns = torch.tensor(returns)
    returns = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + eps)
    for log_prob, R in zip(policy.saved_log_probs, returns):
        policy_loss.append(-log_prob * R)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    policy_loss = torch.cat(policy_loss).sum()
    policy_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    del policy.rewards[:]
    del policy.saved_log_probs[:]
```

## Distributed Training

Distributed training accelerates the training processes on large datasets by utilizing PyTorch's multi-GPU and multi-machine training capabilities. Here's an example of how to implement distributed training using PyTorch:

```python
import torch, torch.distributed as dist
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel

def run(rank, world_size):
    # Initialize the distributed process group
    dist.init_process_group(backend='gloo', init_method='env://', rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    # Load the data
    trainloader, testloader = get_dataloader(rank, world_size)
    # Build the model
    model = get_model()
    # Wrap the model with DistributedDataParallel
    model = DistributedDataParallel(model)
    # Define the optimizer and the criterion
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    # Train the model on the data
    total_epochs = 10
    for epoch in range(total_epochs):
        for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(trainloader):
            # Send the data to the devices
            data, target = data.cuda(), target.cuda()
            # Zero the gradients and perform a forward pass
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(data)
            # Compute the loss and perform a backward pass
            loss = criterion(output, target)
            loss.backward()
            # Update the weights and synchronize the gradients
            optimizer.step()
            dist.barrier()
```

With PyTorch, the possibilities are endless. We hope that this code helps you explore and conquer new frontiers in the world of AI.
