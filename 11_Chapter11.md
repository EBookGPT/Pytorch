# Chapter 11: Saving and Loading Models in PyTorch

Welcome back! In the previous chapter, we discussed the application of transfer learning using PyTorch. In this chapter, we'll explore how to save and load models in PyTorch.

Saving and loading models is a critical component of the machine learning workflow. Trained models can be highly valuable, and it's important to be able to save and store them appropriately for future use. This chapter will cover the PyTorch functions used to save and load models, and explain how you can use them in your own projects.

We'll begin by discussing the concept of serialization and deserialization in machine learning, which is central to the saving and loading process. Then, we'll guide you through the process of saving and loading models in PyTorch using both standard and recommended methods.

So if you're ready to dive deeper into the process of saving and loading your PyTorch models, let's get started!
# Chapter 11: Saving and Loading Models in PyTorch - The Wizard of Oz Parable

Once upon a time, in the land of PyTorch, there lived a group of machine learning researchers who were working to build a powerful AI system. They had spent countless hours training a complex neural network and tuning all of its parameters. However, when they wanted to use the trained model to make predictions on new data, they realized that they couldn't simply keep the trained model in memory forever. They needed to find a way to save and load the model so that they could reuse it in the future.

The researchers decided to seek the help of the great Wizard of Oz, who was known throughout the land for his expertise in all things related to machine learning. The Wizard welcomed them and offered to help them with their problem. He explained that when a model is trained, it consists of a set of parameters, weights, and biases that are stored in the neural network. If they wanted to use the trained model again, they needed to save these parameters in a file for future use, a process known as serialization.

The researchers were excited to hear this, but they realized that they needed to know how to deserialize the model from the saved file back into memory so that they could use it again. The Wizard of Oz smiled and told them that they could use PyTorch's built-in functions to save and load the model's parameters. He explained that the recommended way to save and load PyTorch models is to use the `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions.

The researchers were relieved and grateful for the Wizard's help. They knew that they could now save their trained models in a way that would allow them to reuse them in the future. The Wizard of Oz had once again helped the people of PyTorch solve a crucial problem and continue their journey towards building powerful AI systems.

In conclusion, just like the researchers in this story, you too can use PyTorch's built-in functions to save and load your trained models. By doing so, you can ensure that the models you have spent countless hours training can be reused in the future, allowing you to continue exploring the amazing possibilities of machine learning.
To resolve the Wizard of Oz parable and save and load models in PyTorch, we need to use the `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions. Let's take a closer look at how these functions work:

### Saving a Trained Model using torch.save()

The `torch.save()` function in PyTorch allows us to save a model's trained parameters to a file. Here is an example of how we can save a trained model in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

# Define and train a model
model = MyModel()
train_model(model)

# Define the file path to save the trained model
PATH = 'saved_model.pt'

# Save the trained parameters of the model to the defined file path
torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)
```

In the above code, we first define and train a PyTorch model called `MyModel()`. Once the training is complete, we define a file path called `PATH` where we want to save the trained parameters of the model. Finally, we use the `torch.save()` function to save the trained model parameters to the file path specified by `PATH`.

### Loading a Saved Model using torch.load()

Now that we have saved the trained model parameters to a file, we can load it back into memory using the `torch.load()` function. Here is an example of how we can load a saved model back into memory:

```python
import torch

# Define a new instance of the model
model = MyModel()

# Define the file path where the trained model parameters are saved
PATH = 'saved_model.pt'

# Load the trained parameters into the model instance using torch.load()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))
```

In this code, we first create a new instance of the PyTorch model called `MyModel()`. We then define the file path where the trained model parameters are saved in the `PATH` variable. Finally, we use the `torch.load()` function to load the model parameters back into the `model` instance from the file path specified by `PATH`.

And there you have it! These are the basic steps to save and load PyTorch models, and with this understanding you can now confidently use the `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions to save your trained models and reload them for future use.
